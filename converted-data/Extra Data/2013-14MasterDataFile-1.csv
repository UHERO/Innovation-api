2013-14 Non High-Needs Proficiency (%),"Combined 2012-13 math and reading percentage of non high-needs students enrolled the full school year who scored proficient or above.  No minimum sample size for this report and Recognition selection, but if fewer than 20 students in math or reading then this measure was not used for achievement gap index calculation or Focus selection."
2013-14 High-Needs Proficiency (%),"Combined 2012-13 math and reading percentage of high-needs students enrolled the full school year who scored proficient or above.

"Two-Year Gap Reduction Rate (%) 
(negative numbers indicate gap has grown)",Reduction in achievement gap rate from 2011 to 2013: (2011 Gap Rate - 2013 Gap Rate)/2011 Gap Rate
Used Achievement Gap Exemption in 2013-14,Yes  if school's High-Needs combined math and reading proficiency was greater than the target of 68% and the school was exempted from achievement gap as a result.  Yes indicates that because of the high performance of the school's high-needs students that it was exempted from gap rate in the Index calculation because it would receive a higher index score without achievement gap.
